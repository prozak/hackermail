General Process
===============

For contributions, please refer to the linux kernel development process[1] and
send patches via GitHub PullRequests or mails to sj@kernel.org.  The
contributions should have proper 'Signed-off-by:' tags[2].  The tag will be
considered the same as that of the linux kernel development process.

Running tests and coverage
==========================

To run tests, execute the following command:
    $ ./tests/run.sh

To run tests with coverage gathering, you will need to install the `coverage` Python package:
    $ pip3 install coverage

Once installed, you can get coverage report by executing the following command:
    $ ./tests/run.sh coverage

CI prints the coverage report to stdout
